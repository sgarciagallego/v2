        <p>Ever since I first placed my hands on my dad's beat-up 2000's Samsung laptop running Linux (Fedora 18), I have not been able to stop discovering the world of tech. The challenge of using terminal to install Minecraft at the age of 7 drove me to venture into this world. ðŸ˜†</p>
        <p>Fast forward to mid 2022, and I have had the pleasure of working at a <a href='https://vasavebusiness.com' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>tech-software startup</a>, leading in the build and design of various client and company websites using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. As well as this, I am currently working at a <a href='https://purplebeard.co.uk' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>digital skills bootcamp</a> as a student mentor for the Frontend Development Bootcamps and as a Junior Frontend Web Developer.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the technologies I use during my day-to-day activities.</p>

          <li><IconList />React</li>
